          I might not further develop this plattform within the upcomming days,
          as the external API-service has prooven to be considerably weak.
          <br />
          <br />
          This service is currently saving the HTML-markup of all files with a
          matching search-String from the crawl. All of those matching files
          will be saved in just one and the same single json file with their
          entire HTML-markup.
          <br />
          <br />
          Built with NextJS and Tailwind CSS.
